\section{Difference between architecture and organization}
    \newline
    \newline
    Organization is what most people think of when they think of architecture,
    when organization is mostly defined by the ISA. Organization is the physical layout of the 
    hardware. The layout of the memory stack, how the ICs are alligned onboard are all part 
    of the organization of the computer. This is important as data transfer speeds, power
    consumption, and system functionality are all affected by the organization. 
    \\*
    \\*
    Architecture is essentially the computer's instruction set. The set of rules that define how 
    the processor will behave, which in turn necessitates organizational features. The architecture
    may also include the microarchitecture of the processor, or how the processor will implement
    each instruction in the ISA (a black box to users).

\section{Endianness}
    \\*
    \\*
    Endianness is the concept of ordering with respect to bits in the system 
    There are two types of endianness in modern computers, big-endian and little-endian 
    In a big-endian system, the smallest memory address stores the most significant byte of a memory word 
    Little-endian systems store the least significant byte in the largest memory address. 
    Intel's x86 architecture uses little-endian representations. Little-endian systems 
    are also common with microprocessors due to Intel's influence. Big-endian 
    systems are most commonly found in computer networking applications. 
    There is also another type called a mixed-endian system. A mixed system will have 
    a different endianness for 16bit words vs. 32 bit words. Bi-endian processors 
    can operate in little-endian or big-endian mode.

\section{Floating point format (IEEE)}

    \\*
    \\*
    Single precision format is known as binary32. Binary32 consists of 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1 bit sign bit
        \item 8 bit exponent bit
        \item 24 bit significand component (23 explicitly stored)
    \end{itemize}
    \\*
    Double precision format is called binary64:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1 bit sign bit
        \item 11 bit exponent bit
        \item 24 53 significand component (52 explicitly stored)
    \end{itemize}
